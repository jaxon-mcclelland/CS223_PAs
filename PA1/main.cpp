/*
ADVANTAGES/DISADVANTAGES LINKED LIST

Advantages 
    - If inserting at head, O(1) insertion time
    - No limit on number of nodes, thus easy and quick insertions
Disadvantages
    - Random access is common for this implementation, and linked lists are very slow in that regard

ADVANTAGES/DISADVANTAGES OF ARRAY

Advantages
    - Easy to access array at a certain index, good for random access
    - Easy to implement
Disadvantages
    - Fixed size but the number of players is technically dynamic, meaning the array needs to be expanded often
